<< Project 1 - Maze Generator >>

Given Rows, Columns, and Exits the program creates a random maze and finds 
optimum paths from Start to Exit.

-- Visual Studio 2019 project in Project/GenerateMaze folder
-- Executable application in GenerateMaze/x64/Debug/GenerateMaze.exe
-- Tick Sheet in TickSheets folder

Mazes can be created in the root directory or in the "mazes" folder.

<< Project 2 - Maze with Players >>

Given Rows, Columns, and Exits the program creates a random maze. A player is generated per exit and traverses the maze using 
shortest path to the center.

Each iteration of a player movement, the program will ask you if you want to save the current state to file. If yes, the code will exit after saving file. If no, the code will continue until either a file is saved or the maze is solved.

-- Visual Studio 2019 project in Project/MazePlayers folder
-- Executable application in MazePlayers/x64/Debug/GenerateMaze.exe
-- Tick Sheet in TickSheets folder

Mazes can be created in the root directory or in the "mazes" folder.
